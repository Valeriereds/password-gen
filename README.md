# password-gen

## Description

I've created this random password generator to showcase all the skills I have learned so far using Javascript. I started this project with only a basic understanding of Javascript, but through this endeavor I was able to research, understand, and implement different variables, functions and elements within the script. The biggest problem I had to overcome was the when/how to use a for loop within a function, and the exact for loop formula to generate a random number. Finding out the exact rules of math.random and math.floor were the core solutions to getting the random number generator to work properly! Took a lot of trial and error to get that for loop to work. Also found a way for all error messages to return to the generate button screen, though the real solution I was looking for was how to return them to the proper prompt. I also googled how to remove commas as well from the given random password, which was definitely a neat new trick to find. I'm still learning, though, and with time, google and expertise, I hope to come back to this project with the answers to its problems. I hope this webpage can help any users looking to make a true randomly generated password!

## Usage

To use the random password generator, first start off by clicking the red 'generate' button, located within the password generator box. You will then see a prompt, asking you how many characters you would like your passwords' length to be. After choosing a length between 8-126, the page will then prompt you to confirm/deny if you would like UPPERCASE letters, and again for lowercase, special characters, and numbers. Once the user has decided which and how many characters they would like their password to be, the new randomly generated password will show up in the empty box! If the user gives a wrong number/letter to the password length prompt, the webpage will return it to the original screen.

Throughout this project, I referenced W3Schools and MDN web docs on how to use the proper javascript elements.
